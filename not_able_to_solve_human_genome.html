    Why has reductionism only done so far in solving the human genome?
    <br> <br>
    The bottom-up approach of dissecting individual constituents parts of the 
    genome to understand a physiological process or even just a biological process like the cell cycle has only taken so far as to label all the elements (RNA, protein molecules) that are involved in the process and some of the mechanisms involved in their 
     interactions with other elements. However, it has not been possible, in the case of the cell cycle (one of the many processes involved 
     in cancer formation), to control the process to a desired need/target goal. 
    <br> <br>
    This can be explained by considering all the elements involved in a given process. For example, in the cell cycle, the gene regulatory 
    network involved in it not only includes the role of coding but also non-coding genes. There is interaction to control the process
     at three different layers, from DNA-DNA interactions to RNA-DNA interaction in the nucleus, from protein-protein interactions at cytoplasm 
     to intercellular interactions that are involved in most of the given processes. In other words, it has not been possible to make the system 
      behave to reach desirable states.
