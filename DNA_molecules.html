    <h1> DNA molecules are Turning tapes</h1>
    <div class="justify-text">
   <body> 

    The genome of an organism is made up of RNA or DNA. The DNA/RNA strand can be considered as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_machine" target="_blank" style="text-decoration:none" >“Turing-tape”</a>,
    in which instructions have been written in functional units (genes), to produce specific entities (RNA),
    that further gives rise to the terminal functional elements (proteins), which ultimately make it possible for the emergence of a key ability—to fight the entropy.
    <br><br>
    This ability to fight entropy can be assigned to substrates at multiple levels, from proteins interacting to keep the cell functional to a group of cells working together to keep the organism alive. This 
    ability can also be assigned to DNA/RNA molecules.    
    <br>  <br>
    This ability has been ingrained since the formation of RNA/DNA. DNA became longer (3 billion bp in the human genome) 
    and stronger (encoding for proof-reading enzymes for error corrections), manifesting itself into a more organized cognitive agent in the form of single cells and multicellular life forms.
    <br> <br>

    So, what is fighting the entropy? It is the ability to be organized (gain of energy by a system), not to dissolve into the dark abyss of the universe (loss of energy by the system).
    <br><br>

    The most important question is, what are the causal reasons for the <b> DNA/RNA molecules to gain the ability </b> to fight entropy?
    <br> <br>

    An entity (DNA/cell) gains its ability to fight entropy by cognition to understand this causality of the emergence of cognition and 
    why the main goal of an entity is to fight entropy remains unanswered. Maybe we need to develop a causal model to explain why the primary goal of 
    any cognitive system is to fight entropy. <br><br>
    
    Do not mistake DNA or the genome to be the key component for the emergence of cognition. I have written about DNA because it is
    the smallest non-divisible entity that exhibits a certain degree of cognition at least to reach a specific goal (replicate itself), undergo modifications (loosely can be considered as learning), and
    the sequence itself serves as memory. <br><br>

    The cognition here is not as per the phenomenal cognition, where subjects are sharply classified as either cognition or non-cognitive. I first came across this non-binary form of cognition while reading 
    this summary article of <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2022.768201/full" target="_blank" style="text-decoration:none">Dr. Michael Levin</a>. 
    <br><br>

    In the summary article, a technological approach to mind everywhere (TAME) is proposed to understand how cognition arises in substrates like components of a cell, in a single cell, or in tissues,
    so that the substrate systems can be tweaked to make it functional as per the need.
    The point of this blog is to make a case for the study of DNA/RNA molecules for their ability to exhibit a certain degree of cognition to fight entropy, for DNA/RNA is the 
    first substrate that gave rise to higher order substrates—single cells that posses their own cognition. But I agree with TAME emphasizing not to limit the physical substrate to study cognition.
